    "\n",
    "Volcanoes often exhibit geophysical and geochemical signals before, during and after an eruption. These signals allow volcanologists to monitor active volcanoes to gain knowledge about processes in the magma chamber, conduit and edifice and to potentially predict the time and location of a future eruption. \n",
    "\n",
    "One type of geophysical signal is the deformation or movement of the volcanic edifice and surrounding crust. Changes in the surface of the volcano are related to magma intrusion, dome growth, pressure increase in the magma chamber or flank instability.\n",

    "In 1958, Kyioo Mogi [published a paper](https://radar.community.uaf.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/667/2017/04/Mogi1958.pdf) where he presented a model to explain the radial deformation observed during and after the 1914 eruption of Sakurakima volcano in Japan. \n",
